# Mixed-Messages

This project is a message generator that tells you what to do, every time the user runs this program they will get a new randomized output. The messages are made up of **three** pieces of data to make it random.

## Example:
> You should: trust no one.

*You* will stay constant but *should*, *trust*, and *no one* will be randomized.
