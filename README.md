# Mixed-Messages

This project is a message generator that tells you what to do, every time the user runs this program they will get a new randomized output. The messages are made up of **three** pieces of data to make it random.

## Example1:
> You should trust that guy!

## Example2:
> Why don't you cook my chickens?

*You* will stay constant but every thing else will be randomized.
